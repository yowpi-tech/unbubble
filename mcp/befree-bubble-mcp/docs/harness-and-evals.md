# Harness And Evals

The harness measures whether natural-language requests route to the expected
Bubble tools and arguments, and can optionally compile the generated plans into
Bubble `/appeditor/write` payloads.

Implemented metrics:

- matched cases
- correct tool
- correct args
- missing required argument status
- validation result
- expected warning coverage
- compilation result
- presence of `args.write_payload`
- parser summary
- fallback/failure reason summary
- step count
- deterministic estimated token count
- optional structured visual snapshot comparison
- structural validation status when plans are inspected through planning/execution tools

## Deterministic Catalog Selection

Run the checkout-runnable deterministic catalog selection audit:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/audit_catalog_selection.py
```

The report covers exact-name deterministic selection for every exposed MCP tool,
including required-argument metadata and stability when the catalog order is
reversed. It uses no network access or Bubble profile. This is the structural
baseline for catalog coverage.

Run the Round A.1 natural-language ambiguity audit with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/audit_catalog_ambiguity.py
```

The ambiguity report evaluates 27 curated requests across eight closely
related tool families. Every case names its expected tool and nearby contrast
tools, derives required arguments from the authoritative schema registry, and
must return identical top-five names, scores, and required fields for canonical,
reversed, and rotated catalog order. The audit is local and deterministic: it
uses no LLM, network access, Bubble profile, authentication, or editor state.

The packaged corpus is
`src/bubble_mcp/harness/data/catalog_ambiguity.json`. The general eval datasets below
remain useful for planner, argument, compilation, and visual behavior beyond
catalog search.

Run the Round A.2 modern nested CLI leaf-map audit with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/audit_cli_leaf_map.py
```

The report derives every terminal command path and bound handler from the
authoritative `build_parser()` AST, then joins it to an explicit relationship:
one MCP capability, a composition of capabilities, an administrative-only
operation, local housekeeping, or a catalog gap. The audit fails closed when a
source command is unclassified, a classification becomes stale, a named MCP
capability does not exist, or any catalog gap remains. It uses no network,
Bubble profile, authentication, or editor state.

## Deterministic Data-Schema Precision

Run the Round A.3 data-schema precision audit with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/audit_catalog_schema_precision.py
```

The audit verifies the exact 28 data-schema, privacy, and option-set MCP tool
schemas against their field-role policy: required identifiers and operation
inputs, optional mutation controls, accepted compatibility aliases, and
forbidden operational fields. It is deterministic and uses no network, Bubble
profile, authentication, editor state, or other external state.

Dataset cases accept either standalone snake_case keys or Aria-style camelCase
keys:

```json
{
  "id": "create_text_hello",
  "message": "Create a text saying \"Hello\"",
  "expected_tool": "create_text",
  "expected_args": {
    "context": "index",
    "content": "Hello"
  },
  "expected_warnings_includes": []
}
```

The same case can also use `expectedTool`, `expectedArgs`, and
`expectedWarningsIncludes`. Reports include per-case `parser`,
`fallback_reason`, `fallback_reasons`, `warnings`, and `validation_errors`
fields so agent-routing failures can be diagnosed without opening logs.

Run a dataset:

```bash
bubble-mcp eval run --dataset tests/fixtures/evals/basic-routing.json --report reports/basic.json
```

Run a cheap focused subset:

```bash
bubble-mcp eval run --dataset tests/fixtures/evals/basic-routing.json --filter create_text_hello
bubble-mcp eval run --dataset tests/fixtures/evals/basic-routing.json --offset 20 --limit 10
bubble-mcp eval run --dataset tests/fixtures/evals/basic-routing.json --failed-from reports/basic.json
```

Run the same dataset and require compiler coverage:

```bash
bubble-mcp eval run \
  --dataset tests/fixtures/evals/basic-routing.json \
  --compile \
  --app-id my-bubble-app \
  --report reports/basic-compiled.json
```

The MCP tool `bubble_eval_run` accepts the same `dataset`, `compile`, and
`app_id` fields, plus `filter`, `failed_from`, `offset`, and `limit` for focused
reruns. A compiled report includes `summary.compile_ok`,
`summary.estimated_tokens`, and per-case `has_write_payload` evidence.
The summary also includes `parser_summary` and `fallback_summary` for quick
regression triage.

## Visual Snapshot Harness

Use `bubble-mcp eval capture-visual` or MCP tool `bubble_visual_capture` to
capture a structured reference snapshot from a URL, HTML file, or raw HTML
snippet. Use `bubble-mcp eval capture-bubble-visual` or MCP tool
`bubble_visual_capture_actual` to capture the actual rendered Bubble
app/preview output after a write/import. Then use `bubble-mcp eval visual` or
MCP tool `bubble_visual_compare` to compare the two snapshots. This is the
first lightweight perceptual gate for HTML/Figma/Bubble conversion quality
before a full authenticated screenshot diff is available.

```bash
bubble-mcp eval capture-visual \
  --source tests/fixtures/html/hero.html \
  --selector '#hero' \
  --no-rendered-html \
  --output /tmp/hero-reference.json

bubble-mcp eval capture-bubble-visual \
  --profile my-app \
  --page mcp-01 \
  --selector '#hero' \
  --output /tmp/hero-actual.json

bubble-mcp eval visual \
  --reference /tmp/hero-reference.json \
  --actual /tmp/hero-actual.json \
  --require-images
```

Use `bubble-mcp eval visual-audit` or MCP tool `bubble_visual_audit` when the
agent must move from detection into a correction plan. The audit wraps the same
structured comparison but also emits:

- `issues`: actionable visual issues with severity, expected/actual values, and
  the Bubble node target when available.
- `repair_plan`: ordered MCP plan steps for supported fixes such as typography,
  image dimensions/max-width, container max-width, gaps, and gradient settings.
- `execution`: present only when `execute=true`; it runs the repair plan through
  the normal compile/validate/write path.
- `llm_screenshot_review`: a multimodal-ready prompt and base64 screenshots
  when `reference_screenshot` and `actual_screenshot` are supplied.

```bash
bubble-mcp eval visual-audit \
  --reference /tmp/hero-reference.json \
  --actual /tmp/hero-actual.json \
  --profile my-app \
  --context mcp-01 \
  --parent gp_home \
  --app-id my-bubble-app \
  --require-images
```

Structured snapshots are required for executable repair steps because they can
carry stable element ids/names. Screenshot-only audits are still useful for LLM
review of issues that snapshots cannot infer, such as pseudo-elements or
visual nuance, but they intentionally do not auto-mutate Bubble.

Eval cases can also include `visual_reference` / `visual_actual` paths or
`visualReference` / `visualActual` objects. They can also include
`visual_reference_source` / `visual_actual_source` or camelCase equivalents to
capture snapshots during the eval run. Use `visual_selector`,
`visual_rendered_html`, `visual_viewport_width`, `visual_viewport_height`, and
`visual_wait_ms` to control capture. To capture the actual Bubble result during
an eval, add `visual_actual_bubble` with `profile`, `app_id`, `app_version`,
`page`, `selector`, or `url`; flat fields such as `visual_actual_profile`,
`visual_actual_page`, and `visual_actual_url` are also supported. Visual
comparison checks layout geometry, required text, image dimensions, typography,
max-width, and gradient direction/color order with configurable
`visual_tolerance_px` and `visual_tolerance_ratio`. Reports include
`issue_details` with stable codes such as `gradient_mismatch`,
`root_style_numeric_mismatch`, `node_style_value_mismatch`, and
`image_size_mismatch`.

Regression datasets may intentionally expect visual drift. Set
`expected_visual_ok=false` and provide `expected_visual_issues` with issue
codes or message fragments. The eval passes only when the visual harness
detects the expected drift, which is useful for locking HTML/Figma/Bubble
parity checks without mutating a live Bubble app.

```json
{
  "id": "visual_hero_detects_regressions",
  "message": "Create a text saying \"Hello\"",
  "expected_tool": "create_text",
  "expected_args": {"context": "index", "content": "Hello"},
  "visual_reference": "../visual-snapshots/hero-reference.json",
  "visual_actual": "../visual-snapshots/hero-actual-bad.json",
  "visual_require_images": true,
  "expected_visual_ok": false,
  "expected_visual_issues": ["gradient_mismatch", "image_size_mismatch"]
}
```

## Agent Routing Smoke

Use the `agent-routing` runtime smoke suite to verify that representative user
requests route through the MCP catalog instead of causing the agent to inspect
CLI help or repository code:

```bash
bubble-mcp smoke runtime --suite agent-routing
```

This local-only suite exercises `bubble_task_runbook`, `bubble_agent_guide`,
`bubble_task_recipe`, and `bubble_tool_search` against natural-language tasks
for HTML import, page creation, Figma/style sync, branches/changelog,
setup/context refresh, interactive session login, workflow actions, and visual
quality gates. It performs no Bubble writes.

Use the `visual-repair` runtime smoke suite to validate the visual audit repair
loop itself:

```bash
bubble-mcp smoke runtime --suite visual-repair
```

This suite feeds structured reference/actual snapshots to `bubble_visual_audit`
and fails unless it returns visual issues plus an executable repair plan for
group gradient/max-width, text typography, and image sizing drift. It remains
local-only and does not execute repairs.

## Exporting Redacted Expert Captures

Use `bubble-mcp eval export-expert` or MCP tool `bubble_eval_export_expert` to
turn local captured editor writes into eval-friendly cases:

```bash
bubble-mcp eval export-expert \
  --input /tmp/captures.json \
  --output /tmp/generated-evals.json
```

The exporter:

- accepts arrays or objects with `entries`, `captures`, `requests`, or `events`;
- detects Bubble write payloads under `payload`, `write_payload`, `body`, or `request.payload`;
- classifies operation families such as visual element, page, workflow, data schema, option set, style, and delete;
- adds `expectedTool` hints when the payload maps cleanly to a tool family;
- adds basic `expectedArgs` and `visualReference` data for supported visual element captures;
- redacts sensitive keys and long secret-like values before writing the output.

Do not commit captured project data unless it has been reviewed and intentionally
sanitized.
