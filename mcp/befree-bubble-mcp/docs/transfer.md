# Project Transfer

Bubble MCP can plan, preview, and execute transfers from one Bubble project
profile to another. The transfer flow is preview-first and stores local plan
artifacts before any Bubble write.

Use it for:

- Copying a page, reusable, or element subtree between projects.
- Inspecting dependencies before transfer.
- Preparing collection schema and API Connector transfer decisions.

Do not use it for live database record migration yet. Record migration defaults
to `skip`.

## Requirements

Both source and target projects need local profiles and detected context.

```bash
bubble-mcp profile add source-app --app-id source-bubble-app --app-version test
bubble-mcp profile add target-app --app-id target-bubble-app --app-version test

bubble-mcp session login --profile target-app --app-id target-bubble-app

bubble-mcp context detect --profile source-app --app-id source-bubble-app --app-version test --force
bubble-mcp context detect --profile target-app --app-id target-bubble-app --app-version test --force
```

The source profile is read-only during transfer. The target profile needs a
captured session only when previewing or executing writes.

## CLI Flow

Inspect the source object:

```bash
bubble-mcp transfer inventory \
  --source-profile source-app \
  --source-type reusable \
  --source-ref Header
```

Create a local transfer plan:

```bash
bubble-mcp transfer plan \
  --source-profile source-app \
  --target-profile target-app \
  --source-type reusable \
  --source-ref Header \
  --target-context index \
  --target-parent root \
  --target-name Header_copy
```

Preview the plan before writing:

```bash
bubble-mcp transfer preview --transfer-id TRANSFER_ID --include-payloads
```

Execute only after review:

```bash
bubble-mcp transfer execute --transfer-id TRANSFER_ID --execute --confirm
```

Execution stores local evidence at
`$BUBBLE_MCP_CONFIG_DIR/transfers/TRANSFER_ID/execution.json`. A successful
execution still reports `requires_context_refresh=true`; refresh the target
context before treating the transfer as final.

Check the stored plan:

```bash
bubble-mcp transfer status --transfer-id TRANSFER_ID
```

Refresh target context after execution:

```bash
bubble-mcp context detect --profile target-app --force
```

## MCP Tools

The same flow is exposed to MCP clients:

- `bubble_transfer_inventory`: read-only source subtree inspection.
- `bubble_transfer_plan`: local transfer plan creation.
- `bubble_transfer_preview`: target-session dry run for an existing plan.
- `bubble_transfer_execute`: real execution; requires `execute=true` and
  `confirm=true`.
- `bubble_transfer_status`: local plan lookup.

Agents should call `bubble_transfer_inventory` before `bubble_transfer_plan`
when the request is broad or the source object may have dependencies.

## Policies

`bubble_transfer_plan` supports these policy fields:

- `conflict_policy`: `fail`, `rename`, `replace`, or `reuse_existing`.
- `asset_policy`: `reference_url`, `stage_and_upload`, or `skip`.
- `dependency_policy`: `map_only`, `map_or_create`, or `skip_optional`.
- `reuse_policy`: `prefer_existing`, `exact_only`, or `create_new`.
- `collection_policy`: `skip`, `map_existing`, `create_missing`, or
  `replace_schema`.
- `api_connector_policy`: `skip`, `map_existing`, or `structure_only`.
- `data_records_policy`: `skip`, `export_manifest_only`, or
  `data_api_import_preview`.

`reuse_policy=prefer_existing` is the default. It first maps exact target
resources, then reuses structurally compatible target resources when the source
and target context contain enough non-secret metadata to compare them. This is
intended for styles, option sets, API Connector calls, colors, fonts, assets,
and plugins, so a transfer can reuse an equivalent target resource instead of
duplicating it. Use `exact_only` when only same-key/same-label mappings should
be accepted, or `create_new` when the migration must create a fresh copy even if
the target already has a compatible resource.

API Connector transfer never copies secrets. Shared headers, call definitions,
and parameter structure can be mapped or recreated, but credentials must be
reviewed and re-entered by the project owner.

`conflict_policy` is applied before payload compilation:

- `fail` blocks the plan when the target page/reusable shell or target root
  element name already exists.
- `rename` creates a non-conflicting name by adding `_copy`, `_copy_2`, and so
  on.
- `reuse_existing` can reuse an existing target page or reusable shell as the
  destination context. Updating an existing element subtree in place is not
  implemented yet, so element-name conflicts still block with a clear reason.
- `replace` remains blocked for existing targets until a dedicated destructive
  confirmation path exists.

`asset_policy=reference_url` keeps source asset URLs in copied properties.
`asset_policy=stage_and_upload` is intentionally blocked until the MCP has a
verified Bubble upload path. `asset_policy=skip` blocks when the source asset is
required by the transferred object.

When `dependency_policy=map_or_create`, only dependencies with safe compilers
are created automatically: collection schema resources, option sets, privacy
rules, API Connector structure, and asset references according to
`asset_policy`. Missing styles, colors, fonts, workflows, or custom states must
be mapped or reused in the target project before execution.

Plugin-backed Bubble element and action types are treated as required runtime
dependencies. If the source object uses a plugin that is not installed in the
target app, planning blocks execution and reports the missing plugin element or
action type. Install the matching Bubble plugin in the target app, refresh the
target context, and create the transfer plan again. The planner intentionally
does not write a partial copy that would render as a broken `missing element`
placeholder.

When a blocked plan reports a plugin element/action type such as
`progressbar-ProgressBar`, use `bubble_plugin_install` or
`bubble-mcp plugin install` with that value; the installer resolves the Bubble
plugin key from the prefix before `-`. If the source inventory reports a
version string in `source_plugin_value`, pass it as `plugin_value`; otherwise
the common editor payload writes `true` and an installed-version setting.

## Current Limits

- Element subtree payloads are supported for transfer execution. Page and
  reusable transfers create a target shell automatically when `target_context`
  is omitted.
- Collection schema can generate data type, field, option set/value, and
  privacy rule target payloads when `collection_policy=create_missing`.
- API Connector structures can generate target payloads for collections and
  calls, but credentials/secrets are never copied and must be re-entered by the
  project owner.
- Live database record migration is not executed by default.
- Successful Bubble write responses must still be verified with refreshed
  context or the Bubble editor.

## Technical Evolution Plan

The transfer module should evolve toward deterministic project-to-project
copies without changing the current safety limits: API Connector secrets are
not copied, and live database records are not migrated by default.

Implementation order:

1. Deep-remap copied element payloads.
   - Use `dependency_decisions` as the only authority for cross-project
     replacement.
   - Replace source dependency keys, labels, and Bubble ids with the mapped or
     reused target references.
   - Replace source element ids inside copied properties with the newly created
     target element ids.
   - Leave unresolved values unchanged when the plan intentionally skips or
     creates later resources.
2. Enforce conflict policies consistently.
   - `fail` blocks conflicting target resources.
   - `rename` creates non-conflicting target names.
   - `reuse_existing` maps compatible existing resources.
   - `replace` remains explicit and must not silently delete or overwrite
     destructive structures.
3. Add first-class dependency compilers where they are safe.
   - Create missing styles, colors, fonts, option sets, data schema resources,
     and API Connector structure when the selected policy allows it.
   - Keep plugin installation and API credentials as manual review items unless
     Bubble exposes safe, non-secret editor operations for them.
4. Add asset staging only after there is a reliable upload path.
   - Until then, `reference_url` and `skip` remain the safe asset policies.
   - `stage_and_upload` should either perform a real upload or block with a
     clear reason; it must not pretend assets were copied.
5. Add post-execute verification.
   - Refresh target context after execution.
   - Verify created shells, element counts, schema resources, API Connector
     structures, and remapped dependency references.
   - Return missing artifacts as actionable warnings, not as a generic success.
6. Add cross-project smoke coverage.
   - Run source-to-target transfer with two real profiles.
   - Verify through refreshed context and editor-visible artifacts.
   - Keep synthetic unit fixtures for deterministic regression coverage.
