# Extension Packs

Extension packs are the local declarative packaging layer for reusable Bubble MCP capabilities. They let a developer install and enable additive tool schemas without editing the core package.

## Install Layout

Imported packs are copied into the Bubble MCP config directory:

```text
${BUBBLE_MCP_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.config/bubble-mcp}/extensions/packs/<extension-id>/
  extension.json
  state.json
  tools/
    *.tool.json
  skills/
    *.skill.json
```

The default state after import is `pending`. Enabling or disabling a pack updates `state.json` to `enabled` or `disabled`.

Only enabled packs are exposed through the MCP tool list. Pending and disabled packs remain installed locally but do not add callable tool schemas.

## Manifest

Every pack must include `extension.json` at its root:

```json
{
  "id": "local.simple-pack",
  "name": "Local Simple Pack",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "bubbleMcpVersion": ">=0.1.0",
  "capabilities": ["tools", "recipes", "skills", "evals"],
  "risk": "mutating",
  "author": "local-user",
  "exports": {
    "tools": ["tools/create-plugin-widget.tool.json"],
    "skills": [],
    "evals": []
  }
}
```

Important fields:

- `id` must be a safe path segment. It cannot be empty, `.`, `..`, or contain `/` or `\`.
- `risk` must be one of `read_only`, `mutating`, or `destructive`.
- `exports.tools` lists JSON files inside the pack. Export paths cannot escape the pack root.
- `exports.skills` lists executable skill contracts inside the pack. Enabled
  pack skills are included in `bubble_skill_list` and can be run through the
  skill runner after validation.
- `capabilities`, `exports.recipes`, and `exports.evals` reserve the broader
  kernel shape even though this release only activates declarative tool schemas
  and executable skill contracts from enabled packs.

## Tool Schema

Exported tools use MCP-compatible JSON schema plus Bubble MCP metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "local.simple-pack.create_plugin_widget",
  "description": "Create a plugin widget through a captured Bubble editor write template.",
  "risk": "mutating",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "profile": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Local Bubble MCP profile."
      },
      "context": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Target page or reusable context."
      },
      "parent": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Target parent element id."
      },
      "label": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Visible widget label."
      },
      "execute": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "description": "Execute the write after preview and validation.",
        "default": false
      }
    },
    "required": ["profile", "context", "parent", "label"]
  },
  "annotations": {
    "readOnlyHint": false,
    "destructiveHint": false,
    "idempotentHint": false,
    "openWorldHint": true
  },
  "template": {
    "kind": "appeditor_write",
    "family": "plugin_widget",
    "requiresValidation": true
  }
}
```

Tool names must not collide with native Bubble MCP tools or the Aria-compatible catalog. Duplicate enabled extension tool names are filtered to one schema.

## Validation

Validate a pack before import:

```bash
bubble-mcp extension validate --path ./my-extension-pack
```

MCP clients can call:

```json
{
  "tool": "bubble_extension_validate",
  "arguments": {"path": "./my-extension-pack"}
}
```

Validation checks:

- pack root and files are not symlinks;
- exported paths stay under the pack root;
- manifest id and risk are valid;
- exported tool files exist and parse as objects;
- tool names are present, unique inside the pack, and do not collide with existing native/catalog tools;
- exported tool content does not contain obvious secrets such as bearer tokens, API keys, passwords, or secret assignments.
- exported skill files exist, stay inside the pack, parse as valid skill
  contracts, and only reference tools available in the local MCP catalog.

## Import And Enable

CLI flow:

```bash
bubble-mcp extension import --path ./my-extension-pack
bubble-mcp extension list
bubble-mcp extension enable local.simple-pack
bubble-mcp extension disable local.simple-pack
```

MCP tools:

- `bubble_extension_import`
- `bubble_extension_list`
- `bubble_extension_validate`
- `bubble_extension_enable`
- `bubble_extension_disable`
- `bubble_extension_call`

Import is idempotent for the same extension id: the local copy is replaced and returned to `pending`. Enable validates the installed pack before changing state; invalid packs remain pending or disabled and return validation errors.

Enabled pack skills are managed through the skill tools rather than the
extension dispatcher:

- `bubble_skill_list`
- `bubble_skill_describe`
- `bubble_skill_run`

See [Skills](skills.md) for import/export, authoring, preview, approval, and
execution details.

## Preview And Execute Boundary

Extension packs can add validated schemas to the tool catalog. If a client exposes the dynamic extension tool as a direct callable function, call it with `execute=false` to preview. If the client lists the dynamic tool in the catalog but does not expose it as a callable function, call the stable dispatcher instead:

```json
{
  "tool": "bubble_extension_call",
  "arguments": {
    "tool": "local.simple-pack.create_plugin_widget",
    "arguments": {
      "profile": "cliente2",
      "context": "index",
      "parent": "root",
      "label": "Teste Extension Pack",
      "execute": false
    }
  }
}
```

The v1 dispatcher generates a local preview with the declarative template, schema, redacted arguments, and pack metadata. It does not execute Bubble writes. Calling a declarative extension tool with `execute=true` returns an explicit `extension_tool_execution_not_implemented` result until a reviewed recipe/template runner exists.

Future declarative execution must not bypass the Bubble MCP execution model. Mutating operations must keep an explicit `execute` input with `false` as the safe default. A tool proposal should preview the normalized write first, then require explicit `execute=true` only after semantic and structural validation.

Extension pack validation does not execute Bubble writes. Enabling a pack only exposes schemas; it does not replay captured writes, create elements, or modify a Bubble app.

## Companion Boundary

The Chrome extension companion is shipped in `chrome-extension/` as a browser integration surface for this MCP project. It is separate from declarative extension packs: it is not imported, enabled, validated, or exposed through the extension-pack kernel.

The companion must not use Aria email/password authentication. Browser-side companion auth should be designed independently from Aria application login and should keep Bubble sessions, MCP profile state, and any local tokens under their own explicit security model.
