# Session Capture

Session storage is enabled through manual import and optional browser-assisted
login.

Current manual format:

```json
{
  "appId": "my-bubble-app",
  "url": "https://bubble.io/page?id=my-bubble-app",
  "headers": {
    "Cookie": "...",
    "User-Agent": "..."
  },
  "appVersion": "test"
}
```

Import:

```bash
bubble-mcp session import --profile my-app --file ./bubble-session.json
```

Browser-assisted capture:

```bash
python -m pip install "befree-bubble-mcp[browser]"
python -m playwright install chromium
bubble-mcp session login --profile my-app --app-id my-bubble-app --app-version test
bubble-mcp session list
bubble-mcp session inspect --profile my-app
```

`session login` uses a persistent local Chromium profile under the Bubble MCP
config directory, opens the Bubble editor, and polls until the captured session
passes a real `calculate_derived` request. `--wait-seconds` is the maximum
capture window and defaults to 600 seconds to cover password and two-factor
authentication. Keep the browser open until the validation message appears.

The login command writes progress to stderr. Wait for:

```text
[bubble-mcp session] Bubble editor session validated (calculate_derived succeeded). You can close the browser now.
```

After the validation message appears, it is safe to close the browser. The command will
save the session and print the final redacted JSON result to stdout. Pass
`--quiet` to disable progress output in automated scripts.

Use `session inspect` to verify, without printing secrets, which session header
keys were stored and which Bubble write headers will be computed for
`/appeditor/write`.

Provider roadmap:

- `manual`: import a local session.
- `browser`: open a local Chromium browser for Bubble login through Playwright.
- `extension`: receive editor context/write events from the shipped Chrome
  extension companion through the local listener:
  `bubble-mcp extension companion serve --port 3847`.
- `aria-adapter`: optional private adapter outside the open source core.

Rules:

- Full session data stays local.
- Session data is stored locally under the configured config directory.
- UI clients receive only metadata.
- Logs and reports redact secret-like fields.
