"""Per-tool, agent-facing descriptions for catalog tools that used to share one category blurb.

MCP clients pick tools by name + description. When thirteen workflow tools all said
"Create or modify Bubble workflows, events, actions, conditions, and workflow references."
the agent could not tell ``create_workflow`` from ``delete_action``. Every entry here is
one or two sentences that say what the tool does, what it needs, and when NOT to use it.
``agent_catalog._category_for_name`` consults this map before the legacy category table.
